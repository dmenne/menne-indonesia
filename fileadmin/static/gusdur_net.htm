                                           <br>
                                           Last week I was invited to
                                          officially open an old folks&rsquo;
                                          home at Kramat V, Jakarta. The old
                                          folks&rsquo; home belongs to a
                                          foundation established by members of
                                          the outlawed-Indonesian Communist
                                          Party (PKI) who were jailed by
                                          Soeharto&rsquo;s regime. They use a
                                          building which used to be the office
                                          of Indonesian Women Movement
                                          (Gerwani), a PKI&rsquo;s wing
                                          organization. The inauguration
                                          ceremony in that bright morning was
                                          held in a modest way which was also
                                          witnessed by &ndash; among others
                                          &ndash; SK Trimurti, a senior woman
                                          prominent figure who took part in the
                                          struggle for our independence from
                                          Dutch settlers.<br>
                                           <br>
                                           I myself fulfilled the invitation to
                                          show my &ldquo;solidarity&rdquo; for
                                          their bad &ldquo;fate&rdquo; that
                                          have been under social and political
                                          pressure for years even up till now.
                                          Tens of thousands or perhaps hundreds
                                          of thousands members of PKI and its
                                          &ldquo;under-bow organizations&rdquo;
                                          and even those who were alleged as
                                          members of the outlawed-organizations
                                          were jailed. Many of them died under
                                          a wretched condition. Meanwhile those
                                          who are still alive have no political
                                          right including the right to give
                                          their votes in general election.
                                          Homes and their properties were
                                          seized. They are branded a stigma as
                                          betrayers of the nation. Under the
                                          leadership of dr. Tjiptaning
                                          Proletariati, they establish the
                                          Community of New Order Victims
                                          (PAKORBA) with its branches spreading
                                          across the country. However, for
                                          humanity as well that I have strong
                                          &ldquo;solidarity&rdquo; for them
                                          just like my solidarity for
                                          ex-members of Kartosuwiryo&rsquo;s
                                          Darul Islam and Indonesian Muslims
                                          Army (DI/TII).<br>
                                           <br>
                                           Still I give the solidarity although
                                          I am aware of the fact that once in
                                          the past when PKI was powerful, it
                                          took part in stigmatizes members of
                                          DI/TII as the nation&rsquo;s
                                          betrayers. I ever mention in an
                                          article that those DI/TII members
                                          were recruited by Kartosuwiryo under
                                          the order of the Great Commander
                                          General Soedirman as effort to avoid
                                          a condition of vacuum in West Java
                                          which had been left vacant by the
                                          Indonesian Military (TNI) who must
                                          have left for Central Java, one of
                                          few regions which were &ndash; under
                                          the Renville Treaty &ndash;
                                          recognized as part of Indonesian
                                          territories. A reader, however,
                                          argues that Kartosuwiryo had never
                                          become military advisor to General
                                          Soedirman. He even says that my
                                          &lsquo;theory&rsquo; does not make
                                          sense. In the other hand, he says
                                          that Kartosuwiryo could be General
                                          Soedirman&rsquo;s political advisor,
                                          it makes sense! He (the reader) does
                                          not know that General
                                          Soedirman&rsquo;s political advisor
                                          was my own father, K.H. A. Wahid
                                          Hasyim. That is why my sympathy to
                                          them is as big as my sympathy to
                                          ex-cadres of PKI.<br>
                                           <br>
                                           *****<br>
                                           <br>
                                           Here I want to emphasize that the
                                          past conflicts and violence can be
                                          regarded over, whatever the reason
                                          is. For us now is a &lsquo;strong
                                          nation&rsquo; already established
                                          which therefore no need to frighten
                                          any social and political groupings.
                                          Justice is the matter we must enforce
                                          as it is the main condition for
                                          boosting the process of democracy. We
                                          are great nation with 205 million
                                          populations. We must be able to
                                          uphold justice, and we should not
                                          punish those who, in fact, are
                                          innocent. The death-convicted Amrozi,
                                          in his plea in Denpasar high court,
                                          says that he only created bombs of
                                          small capacity and that there were
                                          other patties who made the higher
                                          capacity of the bombs which
                                          eventually exploded and killed more
                                          than 200 people. Amrozi&rsquo;s
                                          argument should encourage us to
                                          conduct further examination on his
                                          confession. Yet, we don&rsquo;t do
                                          so, that is why we remain uninformed
                                          up till now whether Amrozi&rsquo;s
                                          confession is true or not. We do not
                                          know either who really planted the
                                          bomb in Marriott Hotel, Jakarta.<br>

                                           There are so many mysteries covering
                                          our past that it is just improper to
                                          think of ourselves as standing in
                                          truth while others are in wrong
                                          position. It is necessary to have a
                                          modesty to see what happen from
                                          humanist perspective and not from
                                          ideological one. Using ideological
                                          perspective will certainly make us
                                          easier to see ourselves as being in
                                          truth while others untruth. This is
                                          against the fundamental principle of
                                          the nation&rsquo;s plural life. The
                                          nation&rsquo;s diversity even shows
                                          our amazing wealth; therefore we
                                          should blame no body over the
                                          country&rsquo;s complex turmoil.<br>
                                           <br>
                                           As an example, we can see how Abu
                                          Bakar Ba&rsquo;asyir who is
                                          considered as the mastermind of
                                          terrorism in our country. The court
                                          eventually sentences him four years
                                          in jail through which he is now going
                                          in Cipinang Jail, Jakarta Timur. It
                                          is true that the court has legally
                                          decided him guilty but in reality and
                                          historically it has been confirmed
                                          yet due to the unreliable data on
                                          which the punishment is based. It
                                          takes place also due to our corrupt
                                          courts which are full of &ldquo;court
                                          mafias&rdquo;. Thus, we are not
                                          assured by the court verdict. Just
                                          like the case of Akbar Tanjung in
                                          which the Supreme Court
                                          verdict&mdash;which freed Akbar
                                          Tanjung from all corruption
                                          charge&mdash;will certainly continue
                                          to face public distrust no matter
                                          what the verdict says. No wonder that
                                          now we are sluggish in upholding the
                                          law supremacy. This is it the reason
                                          why less foreign investment comes
                                          into our country: the absence of
                                          certainty in law (enforcement).<br>
                                           <br>
                                           *****<br>
                                           <br>
                                           There is another interesting case to
                                          discuss here. Kyai Mahfud Sumalangu
                                          from Kebumen, Central Java, is a
                                          brave man who fought against Dutch
                                          soldiers in South Banyumas. When
                                          Hatta&rsquo;s Cabinet Ministers
                                          decided to conduct a &ldquo;military
                                          rationalization&rdquo; under the
                                          suggestion of the then Great General
                                          AH. Nasution in which, among other
                                          things, a battalion commander should
                                          have a certificate of graduation from
                                          &ldquo;modern schools&rdquo; excluded
                                          Islamic boarding school (pesantren)
                                          certificate. Kyai Mahfud did not have
                                          certificate from any modern school
                                          but pesantren certificate. Thus, the
                                          kyai could not fill the position of
                                          Purwokerto Army Battalion Commander.
                                          Then, a young military officer A.
                                          Yani was appointed to occupy the
                                          position. In disappointment, Kyai
                                          Mahfud established Muslim Force (AUI)
                                          which was soon declared as betrayer
                                          by A. Yani. The tragic story took
                                          place in early 1950s, yet the bitter
                                          memory remains to the current
                                          days.<br>
                                           <br>
                                           There are many things like this
                                          taking place in our country recently.
                                          Therefore, we must have the heart to
                                          accept other groups whose
                                          ideologically are different from ours
                                          including those
                                          ex-political-prisoners of ex-cadres
                                          of PKI who mostly do not really
                                          understand their own ideology, the
                                          Communism. I, therefore, never
                                          consider PKI cadres and DI/TII people
                                          as enemies who should be watched out.
                                          I even think that those ex-cadres of
                                          PKI are now in search of God in their
                                          life, for what they regard as
                                          &ldquo;wrongdoings&rdquo; are in fact
                                          similar to what they did in the past
                                          when they were politically so
                                          powerful. Now they rely on the belief
                                          they have which are not against our
                                          Constitution. If we take the way they
                                          do, then we already take part in
                                          upholding justice.<br>
                                           <br>
                                           It is obvious that what we need is a
                                          national reconciliation after the
                                          court gives fair verdict to all
                                          parties. If the &ldquo;bad
                                          tycoons&rdquo; could get the status
                                          of Release and Discharge, then why
                                          can&rsquo;t we do the same thing to
                                          those ex-cadres of PKI and DI/TII?
                                          Thus, the correct understanding of
                                          reconciliation is, firstly, a must to
                                          conduct thorough investigation by the
                                          court when the search for clear
                                          evidence is still possible. Here
                                          where the justice in the archipelago
                                          lands should be put down. A strong
                                          will to scrutinize or investigate the
                                          cases before our eyes which took
                                          place in the last 15 years will only
                                          drive us to stop thinking about what
                                          happened 40 &ndash; 50 years ago. The
                                          legal pardon can only be done after
                                          the court verdict is made. It sounds
                                          easy to do so, but difficult to
                                          realize in reality.<br>
